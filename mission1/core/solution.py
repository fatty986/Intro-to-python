# Mission 1 – Main Exercise
# Find solutions to: a * x + b * y = c

solutions = 0

# TODO:
# Use two for loops to try all values of x and y
# If a * x + b * y == c:
#   print the solution
#   increase solutions

# TODO:
# After the loops:
# - if no solution was found, print "No solution found"
# - otherwise print "<number> solutions found"
