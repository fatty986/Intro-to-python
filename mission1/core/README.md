# Mission 1 – Main Exercise

This is the **main exercise** of Mission 1.

You will practice:
- variables
- `for` loops
- `if` conditions
- counting results

---

## The problem

You are given four numbers:

- `a`
- `b`
- `c`
- `max_value`

Your goal is to find all values of `x` and `y` such that:

a * x + b * y == c

with:
- `x` between `1` and `max_value`
- `y` between `1` and `max_value`

---

## What the program must do

1. Try **all possible values** of `x` and `y`
2. Each time the equation is correct, print:
   x = <x>, y = <y>

3. Count how many solutions exist

---

## Final output

- If there is **no solution**, print:
  N solutions found

(where `N` is the number of solutions)

---

## Rules

- Do NOT use `input()`
- Use `for` loops
- Use `if`
- Use `print()`
