# Median of Three Numbers

You are given three natural numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Write code that computes the **median** of these three numbers and stores it in a variable called `median`.

The median is the value such that one number is less than or equal to it and one number is greater than or equal to it.

## Rules
- Do not print anything
- Do not use input()
