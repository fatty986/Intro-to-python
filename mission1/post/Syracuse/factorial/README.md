# Post Exercise – Factorial

You are given a non-negative integer `n`.

Your task is to compute the **factorial** of `n`.

The factorial of `n`, written `n!`, is defined as:
- `0! = 1`
- `n! = n × (n−1) × ... × 1`

---

## Examples

- If `n = 0`, the result is `1`
- If `n = 1`, the result is `1`
- If `n = 3`, the result is `6`
- If `n = 5`, the result is `120`

---

## Output

Print the factorial of `n`.

Do not use `input()`.
