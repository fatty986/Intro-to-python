# Post Exercise – Polynomial

You are given four numbers:

- `a`
- `b`
- `c`
- `x`

Your task is to compute the value of the following expression:

a · x⁶ + b · x² + c

---

## Examples

- If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, `x = 1` → result is `3`
- If `a = 2`, `b = 0`, `c = 1`, `x = 2` → result is `129`
- If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 5`, `x = 10` → result is `5`

---

## Output

Print the computed value.

Do not use `input()`.
