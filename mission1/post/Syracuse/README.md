## Post Exercise – Syracuse (Collatz) Sequence

Given a positive integer `n`, repeatedly apply:

- if `n` is even: `n = n // 2`
- if `n` is odd:  `n = 3*n + 1`

Print the sequence starting at `n`, one value per line, and stop after printing `1`.

Rules:
- Do not use `input()`
- Output must be exactly the sequence values, one per line
